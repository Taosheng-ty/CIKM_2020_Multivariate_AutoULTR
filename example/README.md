## About the json file
batch_size, batch size
steps_per_checkpoint=2000 means, every 2000 steps, we validate our model.
iteration=60000, there are totally 60000 steps.
model_path: where you clone the ULTRA file, check the demo.ipynb.
lr: learning rate
learning_algorithm_hparams: can  set relevance model learning rate and propensity model learning rate, which will make setting of lr not effective.
